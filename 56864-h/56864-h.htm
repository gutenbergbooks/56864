<h2><i>Drippings from the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By CAPTAIN BILLY</p>

<p class="dropcap">Along about the first of September last year, my
cellar supply gave out and on the second day I
had a look of languor like a homesick bum.
Then it was that I met my old “Turk” friend, Casey,
who immediately shanghaied me while he was cockeyed
on a mixture of fusel oil, barbed wire, turpentine,
tuba, rotgut, red-eye, wood alcohol, ether and dynamite.
In fact, his mixture would make the Dove of
Peace challenge the American Eagle to mortal combat.</p>

<p>Casey is a vagrant minstrel of human interest and
I was only too glad to accept of an invitation to join
him at his country home in Golden Valley. But here it
is necessary to explain that Golden Valley is different
than most communities in these good old dry United
States. In Golden Valley it doesn’t appear to be necessary
to distill the corn. Nearly every shock contains
its gallon jug hidden away in the darkened recesses.
The farmers merely leave the empty receptacle and
come back later to find it has been mysteriously filled.</p>

<p>Well, friends and fellow-countrymen, Casey and I
surely worked hard that night in the corn fields and
about the last thing I can remember was Casey mumbling
a story about a colored family in St. Paul named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Henderson—man, wife and two grown daughters, who
had been suspected of bootlegging for some time.</p>

<p>“There is also a coon in St. Paul named Johnson,”
Casey explained, “who got very drunk and was placed
under arrest.”</p>

<p>To the police judge’s inquiry as to how and where
he obtained the liquor, the negro replied:</p>

<p>“I found it in a corn-field, your honor.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever get anything from Henderson?”
asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>“No, sah. Nevah got nothin’ from him.”</p>

<p>“From Mrs. Henderson?”</p>

<p>“No, sah, not from Mrs. Henderson.”</p>

<p>“Nor from Miss Henderson?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ a minute, jedge—is you’ all still talkin’
’bout booze?”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>New Year’s morning, bright and early, Gus, the
hired man, wanted to start off right, so he whispered
to my 8-year-old son to go and find something with
whiskey in it. The lad, in boyish innocence, replied:
“Just a minute, Gus, an’ I’ll go and wake up father.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>I remember the only time I ever was in New York.
I was still a commissioned officer in the army and had
registered at a Broadway hotel as “Captain Gunn.”
I immediately got loaded; dreamed I was discharged
and awakened to find myself shot to the devil. My
brother Harvey, who was a buck private in the tank
corps at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, met me at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Marlborough hotel while he was A. W. O. Ling in New
York. Evidently on account of the lack of tanks in the
tank corps, Harvey decided to bring one back to Gettysburg.
And, believe me, boys, it was a mogul tank he
had when last I saw him. Of course, he’ll say the
same about me—in fact, he accused me of being so
rash as to pat a colonel on the back in the Pennsylvania
depot with the salutation of “Hello, old trapper, this is
a heluva war.” But I really don’t believe I did anything
of the kind. At least I can’t remember having
done so.</p>

<p>On the return to Camp Lee, I carried along a
goodly supply of medicine. Somehow or other, I managed
to land in an upper berth and when I awoke in
Richmond next morning, my faithful satchel and contents
were safely in bed beside me. I cannot recall
having ever awakened with a more pleasant companion
than that old grip. I carefully peeked through the
curtains to see if the coast was clear before partaking
of a morning’s nip.</p>

<p>I shall always have a good word for New York.
After all, our likes or dislikes for a city depend entirely
on how we enjoy ourselves and the friends we are fortunate
enough to meet. I was treated with a reckless
abandon and true western spirit of congeniality. At
first, their language was difficult to fathom, but later
I became used to the lack of the letter “R.” If it ever
happens that Ford cars go up in price so I can sell my
1915 model, I’ll surely sneak away from friend wife for
a week or two of bright lights and green witches.</p>

<h2><i>The Vampire’s Fool</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hello, Tom! Glad to see you. What was that
crowd I saw as I came aboard ship? Looked to
me like an accident. Suicide! Young Parmerly
killed himself, and for a woman!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Good God. Here I am back in New York, alone,
alone; wife and child and friends, all gone; disgraced,
dishonored, and for that woman!</p>

<div class="verse indent2"><i>Even as you and I,</i></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Age comes, the body withers, the brain grows dull,
the blood becomes thin, the soul grows weary; and the
power to live, as once we lived, is taken from us. We
sit, white-haired, blue veined, drinking in the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
through shriveled pores, to drive the chill from our
shrunken frame. It will come to you, to me, to all of
us, and neither man nor God may stop it.</p>

<p>You, Tom, you here? Before you begin, let me tell
you that it is useless; nothing that you can say to me
will change me in the slightest; I’ve made up my mind
and my decision is unalterable. Gone, gone! Tell me
what you think, Tom; tell me what every one thinks;
put into words the scorn and contempt I see in every
eye that looks into mine and every mirror that I look
into. Gone, gone! Tell me something of your own;
tell me the things that lie here and burn in my brain,
and burn and burn, tell me something! Alas, not that;
I know that by heart! Don’t, Tom, don’t try to save
me! What is there left to save—nothing but memories,
nightmares!</p>

<p>I drink to you, gentlemen; I drink to you, Parmerly;
I drink to you, Rogers, and to you, Van Dalm; I
drink to you, even as you drink to me! Bumpers, gentlemen,
bumpers! Bumpers? Good God, what has come
over me? I thought from the beginning it was too late—the
loss of honor, and dignity, and manhood, and self-respect
were all new to me, Tom, and I couldn’t understand.
I cursed myself and swore to God that I would
not become the thing I am. Look at me, The Honorable
John Schuyler!</p>

<p>I prayed to God, Tom, but he didn’t help me. He
didn’t, he didn’t; and I couldn’t help myself. I tried,
oh, I tried and tried, but it was no use; there was something,
I don’t know what it was! It was her eyes, Tom,
it was her eyes, and I couldn’t help myself. I tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
kill myself as Parmerly did, but I couldn’t, I couldn’t,
and the only forgetfulness lay in drink.</p>

<p>Drink that sapped my strength and raised my
veins, and shriveled up my brain. Don’t hate me, Tom!</p>

<p>Pity me, for the love of God, pity me, pity me!</p>

<h3>The Wrong Button</h3>

<p>In a crowded omnibus a stout woman vainly endeavored
to get her fare out of the pocket of her cloak,
which was tightly buttoned as a precaution against
pickpockets.</p>

<p>After she had been working in vain for some
minutes, a gentleman seated on her right said: “Please
allow me to pay your fare.”</p>

<p>The lady declined and recommenced her attacks
on the pocket.</p>

<p>After these had continued for some little time her
fellow-passenger said: “You really must let me pay
your fare. You have already undone my suspenders
three times and I cannot stand it any longer.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="bold">A woman is never so disappointed as when she
asks a man to behave, and he behaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>“Oh, Dear, You Hurt”</h3>

<p>Imagine the scene: A big, comfortable chair, a
beautiful girl snuggled down in it, her head leaned
back so that she is looking up into the face of the man
who is bending so attentively over her.</p>

<p>Now he reaches his arm around her. Her head is
pressed against his heart. Speech at this time would
be impossible.</p>

<p>Listen. We hear her struggled whisper: “Oh,
dear, you hurt.” In a low, earnest voice he says:
“Well, I simply cannot help hurting you a little bit.
You don’t mind that, do you?”</p>

<p>Again we hear only silence. They seem perfectly
contented.</p>

<p>It is not long, however, that they remain in this
position. He does not seem content with what he sees
in her face.</p>

<p>Her eyes are a violet gray. He bends farther over
so that he can see into—well—see into her mouth.</p>

<p>Because, of course, it is the dentist repairing her
teeth.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>Perhaps He Was Lucky</h3>

<p>The worried countenance of the bridegroom disturbed
the best man. Tiptoeing up the aisle, he whispered:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jock? Hae ye lost the ring?”</p>

<p>“No,” blurted out the unhappy Jock, “the ring’s
safe eno’. But, mon, I’ve lost ma enthusiasm.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>It’s a sure sign of being in love if you shave twice.</p>

<p><i>Editor’s Note: In the March issue, The Whiz
Bang will publish a story for girls with movie ambitions.
The scene of the story, which is true to life,
is woven about the home of a well-known Hollywood
character, Prince Troubetskoy. The Prince ranks as
one of the greatest sculptors in the world and his
California home saw many a high jinx. Do not miss
this story, which tells of the system used by designing

<p class="dropcap">Doug Fairbanks must darn his own socks at
night for all anyone ever sees of him. He used
to strut about town with Bull Montana, Kid McCoy,
Spike Robinson and a bunch of other retainers
proudly walking in his wake. But Mary must be charming
Doug in wondrous fashion. He did show up with
Mary at the Mission theatre opening and the two
marched between packed borders of humanity at the
curb.</p>

<p>Mary looked contented and as proud as a queen.
Fairbanks formerly appeared rather sloppy, but, in
severe evening dress, he impressed his auditors very
well indeed. Evidently the two to date have made a
hit with one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>At this writing, Nevada had poked its official nose
into the Fairbanks-Pickford marriage again. It seems
the solons are about to decide something momentous,
which no one gives a hang about. As Kitty Shepherd
said down at Hamburgers: “They’re married, ain’t
they?”</p>

<p>Mary Thurman is said to have moved from the
Beverly Hills hotel. Mary seemed to be in the money
for awhile. It costs to live at Beverly. A pretty thing,
Mary, but life is just one thing after another.</p>

<p>Let us give vent, brethren, to a long sigh of relief
that Mildred Harris Chaplin has ceased yapping for
the moment at least. Or is it just some temporary lull
that goes before another wind or brainstorm?</p>

<p>Now that Charles is said to have kicked thru with
one (or was it $200,000?) Mildred appears to have fired
her parting shot and retreated to a mystic place from
which she is scheduled some day to emerge with a
knock ’em dead voice.</p>

<p>Far be it from us to dispute with a talkative lady
or enter into argument regarding the merits or demerits
of her case. But the public in Los Angeles grew
almost afraid to glance at a morning paper for fear
that the fair Mildred has broken loose again with a new
brand of dope regarding the elusive Charles.</p>

<p>Along about the time that stomach settlers were
being called into use as a result of the slush credited
to the comedian’s storm and strife, people began to
reflect that, though many crimes had been charged
against his curly head, Chaplin himself remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cloistered in a cloud of silence so far as mention of the
fair Mildred was concerned.</p>

<p>Millie did all the talking, or at any event the sob
brothers and sisters placed her in that light. One minute
she was calling Charles a tight-wad and the next
stating that she loved him. Just how a woman can
love a man and simultaneously inform the wide, wide
world that he is a cheap skate passeth understanding.</p>

<p>Several million or so perfectly good white columns
of newspaper space were spoiled with the most wanton
brand of domestic prattle ever dished out in a city
already weary with the frothy doings of its ultra frothy
society.</p>

<p>Then Chaplin’s attorneys announced that if Mildred
shut up and quit using the Chaplin name that she
could take a couple of hundred thousand shekels and
call it quits.</p>

<p>The worst thing Chaplin ever was heard to say
about his wife hasn’t been printed, probably for the
reason that the bepestered young man didn’t say it.
Chaplin may be a cheap skate, a nickel counter, and
own but two automobiles, but his closest friend and
most persistent interviewer never drew from him a
word against the unfortunate partner of his domestic
woes.</p>

<p>Chaplin has admitted that he had no business getting
married in the first place. He declared frankly
that he wasn’t made that way. He said that marriage
interfered with his work and many believe that his sudden
dropping from the pictures was done with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
deliberate intention of not returning to it until his
bread had been buttered on the other side.</p>

<p>It was more a surprise to Chaplin’s friends that
he married in the first place than a shock at reports of

<h3>The Mystery of Mankind</h3>

<div class="sans">

<p>On Christmas we noticed a lot of you angling around with
your tongue hanging out,</p>

<p>And tearfully beseeching everybody to point your ears toward
a place where they sell licker</p>

<p>Made out of barbed wire and red ink, with a touch of rat
poison thrown in to take the curse off,</p>

<p>And you were willing to divorce yourselves from a complete
set of a dozen dollars</p>

<p>For the privilege of assaulting your stomach with a bottle of it.</p>

<p>And when you couldn’t get it you were as peeved as a hen
that tries to get results from a doorknob.</p>

<p>And you are the same lads who were whooping it up for pop
and ice water at election time.</p>

<p>And who said that Demon Rum had killed more people than
the doctors.</p>

<p>If you are a dry, why do you run yourselves bowlegged hunting
for unhealthy licker,</p>

<p>And if you believe another lil’ drink won’t do us any harm,
why do you vote the Sahara Desert ticket?</p>

<p>What’s the answer?</p>

<p><i>Reverend Golightly Morrill, veteran of many
travels in sinful climes, will tell of the wickedness
of the West Indies in the March issue of the WHIZ
BANG, and how he, sophisticated as he is, succumbed
to the enticements of one of Eve’s daughters with a
tempting bowl. He describes his experience thusly:
“Hot courtesan that yields readily, that drinks and
laughs, that stains the cloth and the gown—the ribald
orgy that shows its foot and its leg, quick to snatch its
stiletto from its garter—” Read it in the next issue.</i>—<span class="smcap">The
Editor.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="by">By REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, have the dual reputation of being the
Sodom and Gomorrah of South America.</p>

<p>The theatres of Buenos Aires begin at 9 p.m., and
the Devil’s Mission opens at the same time. I followed
some of his congregation to the “Royal Theatre” and
paid $1.50 gold to stand up in the back part of the
house behind a rail and look at some silly French films.
They were followed by the real entertainment which
was opened by an American chorus whose flat voices
would have been high-priced at 25 cents admission. I
endured it in shameful silence, but the audience was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“cynical,” and by barks and obscene onomatopoeic
sounds, instead of hisses, showed its dissatisfaction. So
far, this was but a prelude to the interlude intermission
when everybody adjourned to an upper and lower foyer
where the band played, the men and women marched
and countermarched, flirted, paired off and sat at the
tables eating and drinking.</p>

<p>The “ladies” were especially friendly to me, alone
and idly looking on. They spotted me as a gringo, and
in French, German and Spanish, Italian and English
said “Good evening,” asking me if I would not have a
drink or go out for a little walk. One coveted my
scarab pin, thinking it would make a nice breast-pin. I
compromised with her on an American flag which she
proudly bore aloft. Another as unmindful of my calling
as I was of not standing “in the way of the ungodly,”
chucked me under the chin and said, “Hello,
kiddo, how’s New York?”</p>

<p>This was the life or death I didn’t care to cultivate.
I told them I had no time or money to waste and that
my wife was waiting for me to help pack the trunk,
since we were to sail in the morning. I returned to
my standing place to get my money’s worth of torture.
It was over at twelve, when I left. Hurrying to the
hotel, I met the hotel runner. He asked where I had
been. “Everywhere,” I said, and told him. He laughingly
replied I was in the “wickedest city” in the
world and hadn’t seen anything. Then he proceeded
to introduce me to the Red Lamp district across the
river, where the sailors are searched and relieved of
their arms; where the arms of the frail denizens relieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
them of their money by charging dollars for dime
drinks; where blistering curses and kisses echo through
the darkened rooms; and where colored movies of
human and animal life are shown that would make the
pornographic pictures of Paris and Havana look like
a Pilgrim’s Progress film.</p>

<p>Here are the painted women whose keen eyes stab,
whose vampire lips suck life blood, whose tresses are
winding-sheets, and bodies graves in which honor and
purity are buried. Happier for them had they dressed
in a shroud, clasped hands with a leper and kissed a
red-hot stove than to have dressed, drunk and debauched
as they did.</p>

<p>These midnight marauders seemed to think the
stars were lit to lead them on from shame to shame,
while the truth is they sadly look down on souls whose
beating pulses live for a pleasure that murders time,
health, wealth, character and reputation.</p>

<p>They follow Satan as a guide, hypocrisy as a lawyer,
impudence as an art, pleasure as an object and
damnation as their end. If their minds were like matter
and could show decay, they would smell like carrion.
They wear fine clothes and live in beautiful
houses, but their minds are empty and their souls in
rags.</p>

<p>Religion has pleasure, but their pleasure was religion,
and Cupid and Bacchus their saints.</p>

<p>The fabled Greek Temple of Pleasure had a large
doorway for entrance, lights, music and lovely women
within, but back of it all a wicket-gate which opened
into a pig-pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, the end of vice is not satisfaction, but satiety,
and the bacchanal worshiper of what appeals only to
his physical senses is thrust out naked, ashamed and
alone. Satan smiles, and hell is happy.</p>

<p>A dying king dreamed he would be met on the
other shore by a beautiful woman and led to a throne.
Instead, he was welcomed by a horrible hag who leered
and laughed at him. When he recoiled and asked who
she was, she replied, “I am your sins and have come
to live with you forever.”</p>

<p>Leaving this bare-breasted, forbidden fruit untasted,
I bought some navel oranges, and went to my
hotel thankful that, if I had been led into temptation,
I had been delivered from evil.</p>

<p>The Devil’s calling cards he gives to visitors
here, have B. A. after his name, and it does not stand
for “Bachelor of Arts,” although he has that degree
from several European and American universities. Last
impressions are first in mind. I had hoped that B. A.
(Buenos Aires) would stand for “Better Afterwards,”
but just before the boat pulled out I found it meant
“Bad Always.”</p>

<p>A well dressed man sold my wife some pretty post
cards, of the city, and while she was looking at them
he took me to one side, whispered “dirty book” in my
ear, and offered me something “nice” to read on the
trip. I read the title, “The Lustful Experiences of a
Physician,” and refused him, saying I was no doctor,
didn’t intend to study for the profession, or do anything
that would make it necessary to contract for
medical services in advance. As the ship sailed out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the harbor I gazed ruefully at this roué paradise of a
city, repeating the lines of the poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Farewell, dear, damned, distracted town;</div>
<div class="verse">Ye harlots live at ease.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Oh, that last night in Rio de Janeiro. The city
was brilliantly lighted but we saw some shady places
to make the picture complete. Passing by the brightly
lighted movie foyers, where the waiting crowd is furnished
with seats and music, instead of being log-jammed
as they are in the United States, I went down
the Avenida through a public park. Its main gate
opened into a street, not filled with churches, libraries
and museums, but aristocratic “maisons de joie.”</p>

<p>There was a corner café with a score of well-dressed
women sitting at the tables, but no men. They
seemed social as I passed by and beckoned me in. When
I went on they followed me with a loose collection of
Spanish, French, German and English oaths. That was
the only way they could follow, for there was a man on
horseback at the street corner prepared to run them in
if they ventured out. It was eight o’clock, we were the
only ones on the street, and must have looked lorn and
lonely, for in every doorway stood a besilked, bediamoned,
benighted beauty who looked compassionately
on and invited us to come in and make ourselves
at home.</p>

<p>A long walk brought us to a kind of Leicester
Square of many theatres. Believing they were all
equally good or bad, we entered one and saw and heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a Portuguese comic opera. It was comical to see some
of the red light scenes we had just escaped, enacted on
the stage. Again we went out of the light into the
night, passing through narrow streets of dives brighter
and blacker than any we had yet seen. This was the
busiest place in Rio. Although it was midnight, an unending
stream of humanity poured up and down the
walks, the patrolling police charging the crowds time
and again.</p>

<p>I was sorry I had not seen Brazil’s “men of war”
because it was foggy when we entered the harbor, but
I was more sorry to see most of them gambling, drinking,
going in and out of the dives along these streets.
Here vice was wholly evil and lost none of its grossness.
It was dirty, dowdy and depraved. Jack Falstaff would
have hurried away as fast as his fat legs could carry
him, and not paused to pity, endure or embrace the
poor, half-dressed, painted, powdered prostitutes.
There is a sharpness of teeth hiding in their cruel
kisses, poison in the honey of their lips, and many a
deluded lover starts up terrified as if he heard snakes
hissing in their hair. Rio de Janeiro is damned with a
debauchery which the natural beauty of its harbor can
not redeem.</p>

<p>On leaving Rio I met two young ladies on shipboard
who told me a “white slave” story. A Buenos
Aires agent for vaudeville had come to New York and
booked them through his agency. He said conditions
were better in South than North America; that they
could each earn $50 a week, and have all expenses paid,
if they would “just sing American songs.” But before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
landing they learned from some one who knew this
agent, that gambling and wine rooms were run in connection
with the theatre, and that it would be necessary
for them to carry revolvers for protection. When they
realized their danger and decided not to land, but
board our ship for New York, they were nabbed by the
police, who work hand in hand with the white slavers,
and had it not been for the American consul and others
interested who raised enough money for their return
passage, and insisted that the contract of the agent’s
false promises be broken, these two girls would have
been placed in durance vile for two years, according
to law.</p>

<p>South America is the white slave market of the
world. She has black slaves in gold mines and rubber
camps of the interior, and white slaves on the coast
who have been brought from every country of the world
with promises of marriage or respectable employment.</p>

<p>The white slaver is the Devil’s missionary who lays
nets which Lucretia cannot avoid, and gives baits and
bribes which move Penelope.</p>

<p>Babylon had a marriage market for her women;
Rio has a girl’s slave pen, over whose portals is written
Dante’s Hell motto.</p>

<p>“She has been in South America,” is the living
epitaph of many a poor girl dead in trespasses and sins.</p>

<h3>His Protecting Prayer</h3>

<p>A celebrated revivalist came to address his flock,
and before he began to speak, the pastor said: “Brother
Jones, before you begins this discourse, there are
some powerful bad negroes in this here congregation,
and I want to pray for you,” which he did in this
fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquote bold">

<p>“O Lord, gives Brother Jones the eye of the
eagle, that he may see sin from afar. Glue
his ear to the gospel telephone, and connect
him with the central skies. Illuminate his
brow with a brightness that will make the
fires of hell look like a tallow candle. Nail his
hands to the gospel plough, and bow his head
in some lonesome valley, where prayer is much
wanted to be said, and annoint him all over
with the kerosene oil of Thy salvation and set
him afire.”</p>

you that no one feels his misses more than I do.” And
still they laughed.</p>

No male being would dare go into a shop and pull
everything off the shelves only to walk out and buy
nothing. Men say they wouldn’t like to give the
trouble for nothing. But it isn’t that at all. They
haven’t the courage. We don’t pull things about to
be spiteful, but to see if we can get what we want.

<h2><i>Pajama Parties ’n Everything</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Hollywood is still talking of the “wonderful”
social season that surrounded Hallowe’en,
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s. Even
away out here on the snow-covered Minnesota prairies
there filters through a story or two. But the best one
we’ve heard is the pajama affair tendered by one of
the real picture queens. The party was probably not
as rich as really painted, but it is known, however,
that in the wee sma’ hours anyone in pajamas could
glide into the festivities whether invited or not. The
hostess, we are told, is such a grand little lady that we
will not embarrass her by any undue publicity.</p>

<p>It appears that during the course of the evening
one of our best actorinos struck up a friendly flirtation
with a prim and very agreeable married woman. That
is, it was friendly at first; becoming so lovely later on.
For reasons best known to themselves, the pair decided
to leave the storm and fret and booze behind and go
and find—but that is the first part of the story.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Along about five in the morning, an hour or so
after he had returned with his fair conquest, Mr. Man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
now rather bibulous, was reciting some alleged woes
and calling down his wrath upon the “long hairs.”
“Long Hairs” is right in Los Angeles just now, except
in high society. There isn’t a night but that the
“morals squad” or “break-in cops” charge down on
some rooming house and there do batter and probe,
dragging out the unfortunate wights who cannot show
a wedding license. It appears that the actor and his
fair conquest, after leaving the pajama party, had
experienced some embarrassment, at least such was the
impression the man left by his startling conclusion.
He said:</p>

<p>“It’s getting so you can’t take a decent married
woman to a rooming house in this town without running
into some cops looking for a bunch of painted
dames.”</p>

<p>Needless to say the fair charmer, who had been
listening somewhat nervously to the initial outbreak,
all but collapsed when she heard the final denunciation.
If her husband hasn’t heard the story, he’s the only
one in town not laughing about it.</p>

<p>The midnight bathing parties in Los Angeles and
Hollywood are a little passé just now, on account of
the weather for one thing. Since one of our best known
citizens was suddenly taken with cramps in one of the
Romanesque pools without wearing even his B.V.D.’s,
the sport has assumed a classification regarded as
“dangerous indoor sports.” In this instance most of
those who ran to the troubled man’s assistance are
said to have been ladies with—well, the wife of one of
our leading politicians was nervous for some weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
lest the newspapers print the names of those present,
so we’ll pass her up this time.</p>

<p>The ladies who bathe in midnight pools, especially
if considerable liquor has been provided, are not particular
about their sea-going attire. They quite often
prefer the no-piece bathing suit, although the shock of
the water often arouses a sober moment. Then milady
wonders with dismay how she can emerge amidst the
highly interested group of lookers-on.</p>

<p>The cops who raid the little rooming houses and
resorts of the less elite would reap a mighty harvest if
they cared to intrude upon Wilshire or Hollywood.
But what’s a little party of pajama-clad men and women
bred in the purple if the copper gets a few choice
jolts.</p>

<h3>Talked Like a Tailor</h3>

<p>The members of the choir were practicing the well

<p>The rendering of the opening stages was apparently
not quite to the satisfaction of the gentleman who
wielded the baton.</p>

<p>He considered it necessary, therefore, to tender
some advice to the soprano section, and caused great
consternation and not a little embarrassment among
his flock by the following announcement:</p>

<p>“Ladies, your expression is simply splendid, but
the time is very poor—really, your pants are far too
long.”</p>

<h3>How Perfectly Lovely</h3>

<p>“Is this—can it be love?” sighed Angebella, as
she sat on a seat in the park with MacCuthbert’s arm
around her waist and his soft voice whispering fondly
in her ear. Oh, it was lovely! “It is, my darling,”
MacCuthbert assured her. “But tell me, sweet one,
how do you feel?” “I feel,” cooed the lady, “as
though my heart would leap from my throbbing breast!
My parched throat contracts and then expands, while

<p class="by">“The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Nature moves oftener to the time of “L’Allegro”
than “Il Penseroso”—the major, not the minor
chord, predominates. The carol of birds, hum
of insects, rustle of leaves, ripple of water and chirrup
of cricket are only sad to those whose natures are
harsh. There is more of light than shadow, and we
feel it as we look at matchless sunrise and sunset,
glinting stars, deep green of forest, lighter color of
meadow and grain field, and the sunbeams chased by
the wind across hillside and valley.</p>

<p>The church is not a cemetery, the minister is not
a death’s head, and his church members should not
be mummies. The world was given us to cheer our
hearts; religion was never designed to make our
pleasures less, and when it does we have less of religion
and more of something else. To be a child of God is
to be a happy member of his family in a present Eden
which thrills the brain, fills the heart, and makes us
rejoice in the hope of a home where sin and sorrow
shall never enter.</p>

<p>The historian Hume found that King Edward II
had paid a jester a crown to make him laugh. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was a good investment. How much better it is to have
a fool to make one merry than experience to make
one sad. Why not have Christmas cheer fifty-two
weeks in the year and let it brighten and bless spring,
summer and autumn till winter comes again?</p>

<p>Shakespeare says, “One may smile and smile and
be a villain,” but I think the man who does not smile
is the villain “fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.”</p>

<p>A smile is the difference between a man and a
brute, though a laughing hyena is preferable to a
scowling misanthrope, and a heathen who only wears a
smile to a Christian garbed in gloom.</p>

<p>Cheerfulness does more for health and holiness
than pills and preaching. Why not smile in a good
world with a gracious God?</p>

<p>The man ought to be arrested who comes downtown
in the morning with an insulting scowl that
curdles the milk of human kindness. One smile is
worth a dozen snarls.</p>

<p>Horace, the Latin poet, taught truth by laughter;
in politics a smile has controlled kings; and Swift and
Heine did more by their smiles for freedom than
swords. We can’t all be poets, painters and presidents,
but we can all be end-men to Life’s minstrel
show. Mark Tapley was always cheerful, and Sydney
Smith said, “I have gout, asthma and seven other
maladies, but otherwise, thank the Lord, I am very
well.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Pacific Coast physicians are conducting a campaign
which has for its aims “the conservation
of public health”—specifically, the elimination of
the advertising doctors, whom they designate quacks,
and the squelching of “cranks” who oppose vivisection.</p>

<p>The editor of the Whiz Bang may be put down
by the doctors as among the “cranks” because he
doesn’t like the idea of vivisection. I suppose I’m
one of those sentimental birds, but any goop who
tries to carve up my dog, my pony, or even Pedro, my
pedigreed bull, will have a fight on his hands.</p>

<p>If surgeons must have live bodies upon which to
experiment, it is suggested they utilize some of the
less useful members of the medical profession. Most
doctors are good citizens, and we include some advertising
doctors, too. They have, it is true, a somewhat
exaggerated idea of importance in the general scheme
of things, but their delusion is honest. They regard
the profession highly, and rightly so.</p>

<p>This being the case, nobody would object if a
doctor showed the courage of his convictions by allowing
his fellow “cut-ups” to strap him on an operating
table and dissect his carburetor and other inside
machinery.</p>

<p>But until doctors assume this attitude, most regular
people will regard vivisectionists as a low species
of bloodthirsty coward, pandering to a perverted taste
for twisting entrails.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Puritans of the city of Spokane, Wash., are
seeking to have a city ordinance regulating the
length of skirts. Our correspondent in that neck
of the woods says he sees no need for such an ordinance,
and that the girls are wearing skirts now that
are as long as the distance from Spokane to the Canadian
border, 100 miles, and that anyway he would
rather live on the border.</p>

<p>However, that’s neither here nor there. The big
question in Spokane, now that the old maids and senile
lawmakers have agreed that the skirts ought to stay
below the knees, is to whom should authority to enforce
such an ordinance be given?</p>

<p>Some seem to think the ordinance ought to be
enforced by the commissioner of public health, while
others want the commissioner of public safety. Therefore,
the question seems to be whether short skirts are
a menace to somebody’s health or whether they are
dangerous to public safety.</p>

<p>We’ll say that it depends largely on circumstances.
If a girl’s short skirts cause a crowd to gather in the
street, and automobile drivers to look around while
driving, then it’s a question of safety. Otherwise, and
in certain other circumstances, it might bring about a
danger to public health.</p>

<p>In any case we declare it to be interfering with
the liberties of the subject. Our sympathies are with
the fair sex all the time. If a girl has a shapely ankle,
why should she hide it? It is part of her stock in
trade—in fact, a show window for the male-and-female
market, or marriage market, or whatever you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to call it. Frequently it enables a girl to obtain a
good position, it is said.</p>

<p>You might just as well expect a girl to cover up
her face if she is a good-looker, or place blinders or
goggles on her eyes if they sparkle too much. Besides,
we have the poor policemen to consider. Do we wish
to take all the joy out of their lives? These cops
virtually live on the streets. Their pleasures are few.
Are we to deprive them of viewing shapely ankles,
etc.? Do let us be a little broad-minded and give the
girls liberty.</p>

<h3>Beware of a Skunk, Dead or Alive</h3>

<p>Men, take warning and never go fur-shopping
until you are entirely familiar with the vernacular of
the fur store. Listen to my tale of woe. My wife
requested that I buy a vermin fur piece for a Christmas
present. Later, when I asked the pretty blonde fur
clerk if she’d show me her vermin, she gave a look that
made me feel like a spare tire on a decootieized tin
lizzie. Then I asked for some skunk and she called the
floor-walker. I asked him if he had charge of the
skunk and he promptly asked me out of the store. But
the fresh air felt so refreshing and Mrs. Bill still wears
her cloth coat of the vintage of pre-war prices.</p>

<p>The new housemaid was, in most respects, quite

in her dusting operations, always appeared to miss a
beautiful model of Venus. “Bridget,” cried the mistress
at last, “why don’t you dust this figure? See”—and
she touched it with her fingers—“she is quite
covered with dust.” “Bejabers,” replied Bridget,
“I hev been t’inking fer a long time, mem, that she
should be covered with something.”</p>

<h3>Authenticated Military Message</h3>

<p>Three soldiers—an American, an Englishman and
an Irishman—from a trench watched a German airplane
overhead. A piece of paper fluttered down and
landed in a shell hole a few feet away.</p>

<p>Thinking it might be of value, the American crawled
out after it. It proved to be a crumpled bit torn
from a piece of wrapping paper. Thinking to have
some fun with his comrades, he returned and said: “It
looks as though it has been of value, all right, but I
can’t make it out.”</p>

<p>The Englishman said he would try, and after he
had investigated he took his cue from the American and
admitted that he also was unable to read it.</p>

<p>“Faith,” said the Irishman, “I’ll bet I can dissect
it,” and he started for the shell hole. In a few minutes
he was back.</p>

<p>“Did you read it?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“Sure and I read it,” he replied, “but all I could
make out was that the Germans are badly frightened
and their entire rearguard has been wiped out.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>The Irish lad and Yiddish boy were engaged in
verbal combat. First one would insist that his father
or mother were better than the other’s. Then it was
their pet bulldogs and their teachers. Finally the
subject came down to respective churches.</p>

<p>“I guess I know that Father Harrity knows more
than your Rabbi,” the little Irish boy insisted.</p>

<p>“Shure, he does; vy not?” replied the Jew boy.
“You tell him everything.”</p>

<p><b>Skipper Bill</b>: Accept my best wishes for the season,
and may each festive day find you squatted ’round
some board arrangement heaped with viands, digestible
and otherwise; and may the platitudes, provoked by
the year’s munificence and the fact that you’re alive,
be salt to the root of the tree of good fellowship. And
may the years to come endear you more to the thousands
of American “Bohemians,” who recognize you
now as a damn good fellow.</p>

<p>Even though the desert remain arid, and we are
forced to sip from lips that burn, and betray, for inspiration,
we’ll remain in the fight until old Mother
Earth calls upon us for our quota of bone and flesh—dust.

down on the job of cotton picking. Too good to be

<h3>It ’Appened in Hingland</h3>

<p>Both the vicar and his curate were extremely
devout churchmen, and so when Lent came round they
naturally decided that each must deny himself something,
and thus set a proper example to the flock.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the curate could not make
up his mind as to what he should forego. He therefore
consulted the vicar on the point and asked what his
worthy superior had decided to do without.</p>

<p>“I shall abstain from tobacco,” said the vicar, in
answer to the curate’s question, “and I can but suggest
that you should either do the same or refrain from
taking alcohol.”</p>

<p>“But, vicar,” protested the curate, “you surely
know that I am a non-smoker and a teetotaler.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I had forgotten that,” replied the vicar; “in
that case the only thing left for you is to put your
wife from you for six weeks and live as a celibate.”</p>

<p>This, the curate agreed, would indeed be self-denial;
however, he promptly proceeded to put the plan
into action.</p>

<p>Already he had got about half-way through this
trying period, when one morning he was awakened by a
gentle tap on his door.</p>

<p>“Yes; what is it?” he demanded, wondering why
on earth he should be aroused at such an unearthly
time.</p>

<p>“John, dear,” came his wife’s plaintive voice from
the other side, “the vicar’s in his garden, and—and
he’s smoking!”</p>

<h3>No Cheap Skates Wanted</h3>

<p>The world’s Stingiest Man shuffled off finally and
departed heavenwards. He was challenged at the pearly
gates by St. Peter.</p>

<p>“What deeds of good did you do on earth?”
queried Peter.</p>

<p>“I once gave a plugged penny to a poor beggar
woman,” the stingy man replied.</p>

<p>The Recording Angel, assisted by Mother Eve,
then glanced over the loose-leaf filing system to verify
the claim.</p>

<p>“Is that all he has to his credit?” St. Peter asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis all—’tis all,” replied the angel.</p>

<p>“Well then, give him back his plugged penny and
tell him to go to hell.”</p>

<h3>Thrift Lesson No. 1</h3>

<p>“Do you know,” said the Englishman, “I gave
my wife a ten-pound note for a birthday present, and
she managed to save a sovereign out of it towards our
summer holiday. Not bad, eh?”</p>

<p>“I dinna think it’s so verra guid,” replied the
other. “I reckon ma wife’s mair thrifty.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Weel, she gives the bairns a bawbee to do wi’oot
their supper, and when they’re in bed and asleep, gangs
and taks it frae them. Then, in the mornin’ they have
no breakfast for losing it. That’s thrift.”</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
